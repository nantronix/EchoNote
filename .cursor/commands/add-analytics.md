- Scope: `apps/desktop/src` folder.
- Usage:
  - `import { commands as analyticsCommands } from "@echonote/plugin-analytics";`.
  - `analyticsCommands.event({ event: "SOMETHING_USING_UNDERSCORE", other_props_a: "1", other_props_b: 2 })`
  - `analyticsCommands.setProperties({ set: {} })`
- Notes:
  - We use the machine's fingerprint as `distinct_id`. All other info should be placed as props.
  - When adding `.event` or `.setProperties` call, make your best effort to not add complexity to code. It is ideal to place these calls inside the `onSuccess` callback of things like `useMutation`.
